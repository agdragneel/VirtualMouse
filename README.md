# VirtualMouse
A python code to implement a virtual mouse with the help of live hand tracking. The cursor moves according to hand movements of the user and simulates left and right clicks by gesture.

PyAutoGUI is used to perform the left and right click functions.

The index finger tip acts as the pointer that moves the cursor around.
Touching the base of the index finger with thumb simulates the action of left-click.
Touching the Index Finger PIP Joint with the thumb acts as right click.
